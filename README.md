#POO Project : MessageApp

## Getting Started :

### Prerequisites:

Download or git clone the project.

### Compiling:

To compile : javac -d AppV1/bin AppV1/src/*.java

### Running:

To run :
- Open 2 terminals
- In the first terminal : java -cp AppV1/bin Main <Port1> <Port2>
- In the second terminal : java -cp AppV1/bin Main <Port2> <Port1>

## What's working :

For now we can locally send both a "classic" message and add it to our local BDD and a "system" message, in our example we chose a "Hello" message indicating that a new user just connected and we add it to the list of connected users.
